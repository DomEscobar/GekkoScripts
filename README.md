# GekkoScripts
Gekkobot scripts that i wrote just for fun.

That are script setups without before i knew that waves bollingbands, MACD and stoch rsi are the most imporant.

Currently im on the track to write a 3day range breakout script that :

- 1. Look at the overall trend (1day intervall)
- 2. The 3hour overall trend
- 3. Bollinger degree 
- 4. MACD and stoch of intervall 3h, 1D, 30min
- 5. Detect trough twitter API the most violation of coins

Maybe later KI with tensoflow
